# branch-int-assignment

Hereâ€™s a polished version of the **readme.md** for your project:

# Branch International Assignment

## Additional Features Implemented

1. Figure out a scheme to help agents divide work amongst themselves, and to prevent multiple agents working on the same message at once.

2. Explore ways to surface messages that are more urgent and in need of immediate attention. For example, customers who are asking about the loan approval process or when their loan will be disbursed might have more urgency than those asking how to update information on their Branch account.

3. Explore ways to surface additional information about customers (e.g. external profiles or some internal information we have about them) in the UI, to provide context to agents.

4. Implement a canned message feature that allows agents to quickly respond to enquiries using a set of pre-configured stock messages.
